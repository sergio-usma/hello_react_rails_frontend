## 💻 Getting Started  <a name="started"></a>

### 🛠 Setup <a name="setup"></a>

1. **Clone the Project Repository:**

   git clone git@github.com:sergio-usma/hello_react_rails_frontend.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Folder:**

   ```bash
   cd hello_react_rails_frontend
   ```

### Prerequisites <a name="prerequisites"></a>

Before you can run the app, ensure you have the following prerequisites and configurations in place:

- **Ruby**: Verify that Ruby is installed on your machine by running `ruby -v` in your terminal. If not, download and install Ruby from the [official Ruby website](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).

- **Ruby on Rails**: Install the Ruby on Rails framework using the following command if you haven't already:

  ```bash
  gem install rails
  ```

- **Code Editor**: Use a code editor like Visual Studio Code (VSCode). If you don't have it, download it from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

- **Git**: Make sure Git is installed and configured for version control. Download Git from the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

- **PostgreSQL**: Install and properly configure PostgreSQL on your development server. We assumes the use of PostgreSQL as the default database. Download PostgreSQL from the [official PostgreSQL website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

- **Ruby on Rails Configuration**: Configure your Ruby on Rails project to use PostgreSQL as the default database.

With these prerequisites and configurations in place, you're ready to set up and run the app.

### 📖 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

In the project directory, you can run:

```
    npm start
```

- Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

- The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

```
    npm run build
```

- Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

- The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

```
    npm run eject
```

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

**To access the API endpoint go to:**

```bash
  http://localhost:3000/api/greetings/random
```
